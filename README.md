# T1A3 - Love even?

## Github repo: 
[Love even?]()

## _purpose of the application

### Describe at a high level what the application will do?

Love even is an application developed to test and rate your significant others level of affection towards you.
The app presents the user with a series of intimate questions directed towards their significant other, the answers from these questions are then tallied up and a score is generated.

A seperate score sheet is used to determine what each score represents, but generally speaking the higher the score the more affection your partner has 
towards you. The highest score describes your partner as 'clingy' and 'infactuated'.

### Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it

This app is the simplest and sure fire way to find out what stage you and your partner are within the relationship. A score is generated based upon your significant others answers to a series of questions, this score will then be used to determine your partners level of affection towards you, solving the age old question "so what are we"?.

The user can also use the feedback provided and apply it to their situation to further strenghten their relationship.

### Identify the target audience

The app is primarily targeted towards women single or in a relationship, but the app can be used by all peoples over the age of 18.

### Explain how a member of the target audience will use it

When using the app for the first time, the user will need to set up an account. A username and password must be entered to set up an account.
The user will then need to fill in few personal details such as name, DOB, gender, current relationship status and ideal relationship status.
The user will also need to fill out personal details of their significant other, such as name, DOB, gender, current relationship status.

Once these details are entered the user is then met with a second screen which displays a welcome message and also displays the users significant others name.
The user then has the option of two settings:
1. Quikie (5 question survey)
2. Full questionaire (10 - 15 question survey)

#### _Quickie_

The quikie setting is a minified questionaire for users who are out and about and wanting to iteract with potential lovers without having their time wasted on the wrong sort of people. The quickie setting provides the user with a quick read on the potential suiter and also thier potential level of affection for the user. Something to be aware of though is that given this is such a short interaction, the level of affection from the suiter to you may be purely physical at first but may blossom to something more if that is what you're after.

The quickie option only contains 5 questions and is less accurate compared to the full questionaire. The major advantage with the quickie option is that it is very flexible, the user is able to sneak in these questions within a regular interaction. Most of the questions are worded very well so much so that to the everyday person they seem like ordinary questions.

#### _Full questionaire_

The full questionaire contains 10 to 15 questions and is far more accurate than the quikie in determining your significants others level of affection towards you. This questionaire asks deep and meaningful questions, it requires more time to go through this option. The full questionaire will allow you to understand your significant other more intimately, whilst identifying he's or her level of affection towards you. This section also provides unique feedback which can be applied to the situation to strengthen the relationship.
